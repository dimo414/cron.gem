Cron Job Defintion File
This file has a special syntax to enable custom cronjobs to be built per machine
Whitespace is ignored
 1. Everything before the first empty line (this header) is truncated
 2. If a line starts with '#' the # is removed and the line is output verbatim
   a. Therefore lines starting with '##' are output as '#' i.e. a comment in the cron file
   b. Lines starting with '#' are output as raw commands to the cron file
 3. Lines that do not start with '#' are processed by the cron builder before being output
   Format of processed lines is like so: 'NAME | CRON | COMMAND' - separated by '|'
     NAME:    A unique name used to refer to this job
     CRON:    The standard cron command (the time pattern) to use
     COMMAND: The command to run
Users can customize which commands are enabled on a specific machine by configuring the
PGEM_JOBS variable in their config file, it expects a whitespace separated list of jobs
to enable.
